## Preamble

If you've come across this post, I assume you're already familiar with what a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) is or [GUT](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut).

If not, here's a quick overview and some links for you. Feel free to skip this part if you already know your way around.

### GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions allow you to run **actions** on specific events, for example, on PRs and commit pushes.
- These actions are defined using YAML files inside your GitHub Repo.
- GitHub Actions are hosted by GitHub, and you have access to [Ubuntu, Windows, and MacOS hosts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).
- [Here are the full Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), but continue reading, I hope it will explain itself to some extent.

### GUT - Godot Unit Testing

- GUT is used to write unit and integration tests in Godot.
- What is a unit test?
  - Unit Tests test a unit of your code, most times a unit will be one function, and you will call a function with some input and check if you get the desired output.
- What is integration testing?
  - Integration testing simulates the actual usage of your software, instead of testing the individual component/functions. The input for integration tests, for example, is starting the game ‚Üí opening the inventory and checking if the inventory is actually open. This allows you to check if all the individual parts of your program work together correctly.
- Why do you want to run tests?
  - Allows you to see if you broke a part of your program without touching it.
  - Simplifies Code Review (You don‚Äôt have to test every PR manually, or yolo merge).
  - You get a nice green checkmark each time your tests pass ‚úÖ

## What I Built

This will be a write-up of what I did for the Mod Loader Repo. So, this is not so much a follow-along tutorial but more like ‚Äúlook at what I did here‚Äù.

![Art](/imgs/memes/art.png)

You can find my art on the [Godot Mod Loader Repo](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader/tree/main/.github/workflows).  
You can also speedrun this post and just look [at the PR](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader/pull/360) that includes all of this.  
Here is the structure I ended up with:

```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ godot-install/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ action.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests.yml
```

In the following, I will (try) to explain what each of these files do.

## Tests Workflow

Let's dive right in, here is the full test workflow file.

<details open>
<summary>üî¥ We are here ‚Üí <code>.github/workflows/tests.yml</code></summary>

```yaml
# Inspired by https://github.com/bitbrain/beehave/blob/godot-4.x/.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml

name: tests
run-name: ${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}-tests

on: # <-- This workflow is called `on` `workflow_call` or `workflow_dispatch`.
	workflow_call: # So this will be called by a different workflow file,
		inputs: # More on that later (it's the main.yml, yes).
			os: # <-- We do have 2 inputs here `os`
				required: false
				type: string
				default: 'ubuntu-22.04'
			godot-version: # <-- and `godot-version`, this can be passed with the
				required: true # `with` keyword from the "parent" workflow.
				type: string
				default: '3.5.3'

	workflow_dispatch:
		inputs:
			os:
				required: false
				type: string
				default: 'ubuntu-22.04'
			godot-version:
				required: true
				type: string

concurrency:
	group: tests-${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}-${{ inputs.godot-version }}
	cancel-in-progress: true

jobs: # <-- Here we go, the job
	test:
		name: "Tests"
		runs-on: ${{ inputs.os }} # <-- We want to run this on Linux / Ubuntu
		timeout-minutes: 15 # <-- In the end, the test run will only take a few seconds

		steps: # <-- a job has steps
			- name: "üì¶ Checkout Mod Loader Repository"
				uses: actions/checkout@v4 # <-- Let's get the code that has been pushed
				with:
					lfs: true # <-- If your repo has big files you want that
					submodules: 'recursive' # <-- If your repo has submodules you want that

			- name: "ü§ñ Install Godot ${{ inputs.godot-version }}"
				uses: ./.github/actions/godot-install # <-- I will talk about that one
				with: # <-- here is the `with` keyword I was talking about
					godot-version: ${{ inputs.godot-version }} # <-- Remember these inputs
					godot-status-version: 'stable' # they get passed to the
					godot-bin-name: 'linux_headless.64' # godot-install action.
					godot-cache-path: '~/godot-linux'

			- name: "üß™ Run Tests"
				if: ${{ !cancelled() }} # <-- We check if the download failed here
				timeout-minutes: 4
				uses: ./.github/actions/test # <-- I will talk about that one
				with:
					godot-test-project: ${{ github.workspace }}/test # <-- This is where
					# The `checkout` action put the code
```

</details>

## **Get the Current Code of the PR**

üî¥ `.github/workflows/tests.yml` `jobs: - steps: - actions/checkout@v4`

That‚Äôs the easiest part, we use the [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout).

- `lfs: true` defines that we also want to clone [large files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage).
- `submodules: 'recursive'` includes all submodules if you have any in your repo.

This will download all the code to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, if we look at [the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables), that should be here `/home/runner/work/my-repo-name/my-repo-name`.

## Godot Download Action

Here things can get a bit more involved.

I decided to take all inspiration from repos that did the download manually, but there is also [godot-action](https://github.com/paulloz/godot-action/tree/main) that might be the thing for you. I did not try it, so here is what I did.

<details open>
	<summary>
	üî¥ We are here ‚Üí <code>.github/actions/godot-install/action.yml</code>
	</summary>

```yaml

description: "Installs the Godot Runtime"

				chmod 770 ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }} # <-- Set the right rights
				DIR="$HOME/.config/godot"
				if [ ! -d "$DIR" ]; then
					mkdir -p "$DIR"
					chmod 770 "$DIR"
				fi

				DOWNLOAD_URL=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/${{ inputs.godot-version }}-${{ inputs.godot-status-version }}
				GODOT_BIN=Godot_v${{ inputs.godot-version }}-${{ inputs.godot-status-version }}_${{ inputs.godot-bin-name }}

				# üëá Unzip the file
				unzip ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/$GODOT_PACKAGE -d ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}

				# üëá Rename the executable to `godot`
				mv ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/$GODOT_BIN ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/godot

				# üëá Set the execution right for the executable
				chmod u+x ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/godot
				# üëá Print the path to the executable
				echo "${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/godot"

		- name: "Godot Cache Save"
			if: steps.godot-restore-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true' # <-- no cache?
			uses: actions/cache/save@v3 # <-- Then cache the downloaded files
			with:
				path: ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}
				key: ${{ steps.godot-restore-cache.outputs.cache-primary-key }}
```

</details>

### Passing `inputs` with `with`

At the top, we define the `inputs` for the download action. These `inputs` are passed to the action with the `with` property in the ‚Äúparent‚Äù workflow file.

```yaml
with:
  godot-version: ${{ inputs.godot-version }}
  godot-status-version: 'stable'
  godot-bin-name: 'linux_headless.64'
  godot-cache-path: '~/godot-linux'
```

### Cache

Caching larger dependencies can speed up your actions tremendously, so it's worth the hassle to set up. The [cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache) is used for that, with a restore and save step.

Both will require a `key` and the `path` to the files.

[A key can be generated in many ways](https://github.com/actions/cache?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-a-cache-key), and for my use case, a simple `echo "some string"` is enough.

```yaml
- name: 'Set Cache Name'
  shell: bash
  run: |
    echo "CACHE_NAME=${{ runner.OS }}-Godot_v${{ inputs.godot-version }}-${{ inputs.godot-status-version }}" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
```

### Cache - **Restore**

We call `actions/cache/restore@v3`, give it an `id`, and pass the `path` to the downloaded Godot file and the `key` that has been created. The cache action will check for cached files for this `key` now and return `cache-hit` as either `true` or `false`.

```yaml
- name: 'Godot Cache Restore'
  uses: actions/cache/restore@v3
  id: godot-restore-cache
  with:
    path: ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}
    key: ${{ env.CACHE_NAME }}
```

This can be accessed in the following steps by checking like this:

```yaml
if: steps.godot-restore-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
```

### Cache - **Save**

After the download step (that we have not yet talked about), we can store these files with `actions/cache/save@v3`. I skip this step if we already have something cached and pass the same inputs as the restore action gets.

```yaml
- name: 'Godot Cache Save'
  if: steps.godot-restore-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
  uses: actions/cache/save@v3
  with:
    path: ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}
    key: ${{ steps.godot-restore-cache.outputs.cache-primary-key }}
```

Nice, this will now restore the Godot download after it has been downloaded once, shaving off a couple of seconds from the action run time.

![fast](/imgs/memes/fast.png)

### The Actual Godot Download

Now, here it is. We start by checking if we have cached files with

```yaml
if: steps.godot-restore-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
```

and tell the action that things are bad if the download fails with

```yaml
continue-on-error: false
```

This will allow us to check if the run has failed with `${{ !cancelled() }}` later.

We have to tell the action what shell to use with `shell: bash` and continue to `run` the shell script.

Starting with the creation of all required directories and setting the right rights for them:

```bash
mkdir -p ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}
chmod 770 ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}
DIR="$HOME/.config/godot"
if [ ! -d "$DIR" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$DIR"
  chmod 770 "$DIR"
fi
```

We build some nice variables for the download link with the `inputs` we passed to the action:

```bash
DOWNLOAD_URL=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/${{ inputs.godot-version }}-${{ inputs.godot-status-version }}
GODOT_BIN=Godot_v${{ inputs.godot-version }}-${{ inputs.godot-status-version }}_${{ inputs.godot-bin-name }}
GODOT_PACKAGE=$GODOT_BIN.zip
```

Next, the Godot executable is downloaded from GitHub with the created download link and unzipped. For Mod Loader, I download the 3.5.3 headless Linux version from `https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/3.5.3-stable/Godot_v3.5.3-stable_linux_headless.64.zip` .

```bash
wget $DOWNLOAD_URL/$GODOT_PACKAGE -P ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}
unzip ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/$GODOT_PACKAGE -d ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}
```

Let‚Äôs rename the executable to make it easier to access later.

```bash
mv ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/$GODOT_BIN ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/godot
```

and set the execution right so we can actually run Godot later.

```bash
chmod u+x ${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/godot
```

At the end, we just print the path to the executable.

```bash
echo "${{ inputs.godot-cache-path }}/godot"
```

That's it! Now we can download or restore the Godot headless Linux executable and access it from `~/godot-linux/godot`.

## Testing Godot Project

Before we continue looking at the next action, let's take a quick detour on how I set up the tests for the [Mod Loader Repo](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader). I created a new Godot Project locally and added GUT from the Asset Lib, linking `mod_load` and `JSON_Schema_Validator`. I already had some unit tests written to test the Mod Manifest validation, and I added one to check if mods get sorted as they should. I will not go into how to write tests, there are a lot of good videos on YouTube, or just check out the [GUT Docs](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki).

Currently, I have two scripts to run tests:

```
test/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Unit/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_manifest_validation.gd
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_script_extension_sorting.gd

```

### GUT Config and CLI

To run GUT from the action, we use the CLI provided via `gut_cmdln.gd`. Check out the [CLI Docs](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Command-Line) for details. I took inspiration from the [fmod-gdextension](https://github.com/utopia-rise/fmod-gdextension/tree/godot-3.x). They added a [separate shell script](https://github.com/utopia-rise/fmod-gdextension/blob/godot-3.x/demo/run_tests.sh) at the root of the testing project. They do some fancy checking for `"failing asserts: 0‚Äù`, but that is not needed anymore. GUT will exit Godot and return an appropriate exit code depending on the test results. So my `run_tests.sh` is just one line:

```bash
$1 -d -s --path $PWD addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd
```

I also copied the example `.gutconfig.json`, all I changed is the `"dirs"` array:

```json
{
  "dirs": ["res://Unit/"],
  "double_strategy": "partial",
  "ignore_pause": false,
  "include_subdirs": true,
  "inner_class": "",
  "log_level": 3,
  "opacity": 100,
  "prefix": "test_",
  "selected": "",
  "should_exit": true,
  "should_maximize": true,
  "suffix": ".gd",
  "tests": [],
  "unit_test_name": ""
}
```

To avoid duplicating the mod loader code in the repo or having a complete GUT installation in the diffs, I added all the addon stuff to a new `.gitignore` for the test project:

```
.import/
*.import
addons/

# Gut stuff in the root dir
asset_lib_icon.png
gut_panel.png
.gut_editor_shortcuts.cfg
BigFont.tres
BigFontTheme.tres
```

To also ignore the tests for asset lib downloads, we added them to the `.gitattributes`:

```
[...]

# Tests
test/                                   export-ignore

[...]
```

Now back to the GitHub Action!

## Run GUT Test Action

```

</details>

Most of what is happening in this action has already been covered, so just a quick overview:

1. We generate the cache key ‚Üí `Linux-GUT_v7.4.1`.
2. `actions/cache/restore@v3` tries to restore files with this key.
3. If there is no cache, GUT is downloaded from GitHub and stored in `${{ inputs.gut-download-path }}` and unzipped to `${{ inputs.gut-download-path }}/unzip`.
4. `actions/cache/save@v3` saves the downloaded GUT files if there is no cache yet.
5. The `addons` dir is created in the test project; remember `${{ github.workspace }}` is where `actions/checkout@v4` put the pushed code in the beginning.
6. GUT, Mod Loader, and JSON Schema Validator are linked into the `addons` dir.
7. `run_tests.sh` is called and [runs all the tests using the GUT CLI](#gut-config-and-cli).

Nice, almost done!

## Main Workflow

At the moment, all this hard work is never executed. To instruct GitHub to run all these tasks on a PR and if new code has been pushed, I use the `main.yml` workflow.

<details open>
	<summary>
	üî¥ We are here ‚Üí <code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code>
	</summary>

```yaml
# Inspired by https://github.com/bitbrain/beehave/blob/godot-4.x/.github/workflows/beehave-ci.yml

name: Mod Loader CI

on:
	push: # <-- We want to run the `jobs` on `push`
		paths-ignore:
			- '**.jpg'
			- '**.png'
			- '**.svg'
			- '**.md'
			- '**plugin.cfg'
	pull_request: # and if a new PR is created.
		paths-ignore:
			- '**.jpg'
			- '**.png'
			- '**.svg'
			- '**.md'
			- '**plugin.cfg'

concurrency:
	group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
	cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
	check_dependencies: # <-- We use the dependencies-action to check if a PR depends
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest # on a different PR.
		name: PR Dependency Check
		steps:
		- uses: gregsdennis/dependencies-action@main
			env:
				GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
	tests: # <-- Here is all the hard work
		name: "Running GUT tests on Godot 3.5.3"
		uses: ./.github/workflows/tests.yml # <-- this will run the tests workflow
		with:
			godot-version: '3.5.3'

```

</details>

The `tests.yml` workflow is defined to run `on:` `workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch`.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call: [...]

  workflow_dispatch: [...]
```

So we tell GitHub in the `main.yml` to run the `tests.yml` workflow `on:`

```yaml
on:
  push: [...]
  pull_request: [...]
```

Now we just add the call to action in the `jobs:` section:

```yaml
tests:
  name: 'Running GUT tests on Godot 3.5.3'
  uses: ./.github/workflows/tests.yml
  with:
    godot-version: '3.5.3'
```

And there we go üéâ

A complete workflow to download Godot, GUT, and run tests.

## Local Development - Act It Out

The best way to get a general idea of whether your GitHub Action is working is with [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

[act](https://github.com/nektos/act) allows you to run your actions on your machine, so you don‚Äôt have to spam commits to test if the basics are working. I‚Äôm on Windows and already had [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) set up. So, I just downloaded [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and was up and running. (Not really, my last BIOS update reset CPU virtualization, so I got some errors to decipher). I used [this blog post](https://medium.com/@debasishkumardas5/running-github-actions-locally-a-complete-guide-for-windows-mac-and-linux-users-34c45999c7cd) to guide me through the [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) installation.

With [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) set up, I can simulate the `push` action, and it will run the `main.yml`.

All I have to do is run `act push` and watch it go üëÄ

Be prepared to see things crash and burn. It's really easy to mess up some indentation in a `.yml` file, but if I can get it working, you can too üí™

You'll most likely also find out that [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) can‚Äôt simulate the live environment of the action one-to-one. For example, the `$HOME` or `~` will point at a different path in production. So make sure not to hard code paths to `home`.

## Conclusion

So that was a walk in the park, right?

Quick Recap:

- 2 actions [`godot-install`](#godot-download-action) and [`test`](#run-gut-test-action)
- called by the [`test.yml` workflow](#tests-workflow)
- that is called in the [`main.yml` workflow](#main-workflow)
- the [`main` workflow](#main-workflow) is run `on:` `push` and `pull_request`
